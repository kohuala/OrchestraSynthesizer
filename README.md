# Orchestra Sythesizer

**Abstract**

String synthesis is the science of generating sound waves to create a string synthesizer. This machine is designed to specifically meet the requirement of creating polyphonic sounds of a real life orchestra. Such a design will be incorporated into contemporary music while minimizing cost of individual synthesizers for different instruments. My project focuses on the sound generation of plucked string instruments (guitar) with Karplus Strong algorithm  and the sound generation of bowed string instruments(double bass, cello, viola and violin) with the fractional delay and allpass delay line interpolation. These tones will be played in real-time by the user on a computer keyboard.  The results show a realistic tone from C3 (130 Hz) to C6 (1046.5 Hz).
